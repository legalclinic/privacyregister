# Privacy Register
Article 30 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) brings into existence an obligation for controllers and processors to maintain a record of processing activities.
Privacy Register creates an open standard that could be used to fulfill the obligations that arise under article 30 GDPR.

The aim of Privacy Register is to make it easier to set up, maintain and share a record of processing activities.

The record must contain information about the types of personal data a controller or processor stores and processes and which security measures have been taken.

Privacy Register's open standard incorporates all information as required in article 30 GDPR and gives a base level for compliance with article 30 GDPR. Compliance ultimately depends on the information the user submits and the ways in which the user makes use of the standard.

We encourage everyone with an interest in privacy law to contribute to the project by forking the project and submitting a pull request.
