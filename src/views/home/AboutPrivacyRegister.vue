          <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Why?</h5>

          <ul class="small">
            <li>Article 30 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) brings into existence an obligation for controllers and processors to maintain a record of processing activities.</li>
            <li>Privacy Register creates an open standard that could be used to fulfill the obligations that arise under article 30 GDPR.</li>
            <li>The aim of Privacy Register is to make it easier to set up, maintain and share a record of processing activities.</li>
            <li>The record must contain information about the types of personal data a controller or processor stores and processes and which security measures have been taken.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Who are we?</h5>
          <p><small>
            Privacy Register has been created by students of Clinic Law Incubator, a law incubator specialised in IP/IT law and Privacy from Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
            We encourage everyone with an interest in privacy law to contribute to the project by forking the project and submitting a pull request.
          </small></p>

          <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">What?</h5>
          <p><small>
            Privacy Register's open standard incorporates all information as required in article 30 GDPR and gives a base level for compliance with article 30 GDPR.
            Compliance ultimately depends on the information the user submits and the ways in which the user makes use of the standard.
          </small></p>

          <h5 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">For whom?</h5>
          <p><small>
          The open standard as proposed in this <b-link href="https://github.com/legalclinic/privacyregister-standard/blob/master/Privacy%20Register%20White%20Paper%20%5BEN%5D.md" target="_blank">white paper</b-link> is designed as to be fit for use for most organisations.
          Specific requirements should be determined on an organisational level.
